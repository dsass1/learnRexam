## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been pre-loaded for you. All necessary libraries have been pre-loaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.


### Application 1 (1 points)

Load the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` package.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (5 points)

Construct a scatterplot of `followers_tiktok` by `followers_insta`. Set the `color` equal to `procrastinator`.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = followers_insta, y = followers_tiktok, color = procrastinator)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

In **one sentence** describe the relationship between the number of followers a student has on Instagram and Tiktok. In **one sentence** state **why** you are or are not surprised by this relationship.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```


### Application 3 (4 points)

Let's determine if North campus, South campus, or off campus students (Neither) attend more parties. Don't include First year students because they are new to school and may not know people yet.

In other words,

- start with the `survey` data
- exclude student's that have `school_year` of "First year"
- compute the median, IQR, and count of `num_party` by `campus_housing`.
- print/output the results with the highest median on top

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  filter(school_year != "First year") %>% 
  group_by(campus_housing) %>% 
  summarize(median = median(num_party, na.rm = TRUE),
            IQR = IQR(num_party, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(median))
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 4 (5 points)

Construct a side-by-side boxplot of `num_party` by `campus_housing`. Change the fill to "skyblue".

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}


```


```{r App4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = campus_housing, y = num_party)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue")
```

```{r App4-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Describe and compare the boxplots.

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (winter 2023, fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `procrastinator` -- "Do you consider yourself a procrastinator? (Yes, No)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `followers_insta` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `followers_tiktok` -- "How many followers do you have on TikTok (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"

```{r}
