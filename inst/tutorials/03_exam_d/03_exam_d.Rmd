## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `salaries` dataset which has been preloaded for you. 
This data is a random sample of Illinois public university professors and includes information such as salary, service, and job title. 

<br>

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **public university professors in Illinois.**.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem for each possible scenario with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

*You do not need the dataset for this application.*

Suppose the salary of an assistant professor follows a normal distribution with mean 100 thousand dollars and sd 20 thousand dollars. 

What proportion of professors earn **between** 90 and 135 thousand dollars?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(135, mean = 100, sd = 20) - pnorm(90, mean = 100, sd = 20)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

The highest 15% of assistant professors earn more than how much?

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.15, mean = 100, sd = 20, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the difference in the average `base_salary` that public University professors in Illinois earn who work for the `Math` department and the average `base_salary` that public University professors in Illinois earn who work for the `Sociology` department.

<br>

Note: `base_salary` is reported in \$1,000 ie: 50 = \$50,000.

<br>

In other words, use the `department` and `base_salary` variables in the `salaries` data to **construct a 96% confidence interval** for the difference in means. 

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```



```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
math <- salaries |> 
  filter(department == "Math")

sociology <- salaries |> 
  filter(department == "Sociology")

t.test(x = math$base_salary, sociology$base_salary, conf.level = 0.96)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer: is there a difference in means, if so, do Math professors or Sociology professors earn more money?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

Evaluate the claim that at least 45% of `Full Professor`s at public Universities in Illinois are `F`emale. 

Use the `salaries` data, `gender` and `title` variables to conduct a hypothesis test for the proportion of `Full Professor`s at public Universities in Illinois that are `F`emale at the $\alpha$ = 0.10 significance level. <br> <br> Are more than 45% of full professor's female??

<br>
ie: we surveyed only `Full Professor`s and asked if they were `F`emale


$$H_0: \pi_{female} = 0.45$$
$$H_A: \pi_{female} \ne 0.45$$



```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
salaries |> 
  filter(title == "Full Professor") |> 
  count(gender)

prop.test(x = 43, n = c(43+83), p = .45, conf.level = 0.9, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```
