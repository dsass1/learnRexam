## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey_sample` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **Northwestern Students who take STAT 202 from Fall 2021 - Fall 2023**.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

*You do not need the dataset for this application.*

Suppose the number of minutes that a student athlete exercises each week follows a normal distribution with mean 500 and sd 100. 

What proportion of athletes exercise **between** 350 and 650 minutes?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(650, mean = 500, sd = 100) - pnorm(350, mean = 500, sd = 100)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

The top 20% of athletes exercise more than how many minutes?

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.2, mean = 500, sd = 100, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the difference in proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU that live in `North campus` who go to "5+" parties a month and `South campus` who go to "5+" parties a month.

In other words, use the `campus_housing` and `party_bin` variables in the `survey_sample` data to **construct a 90% confidence interval** for the difference in proportions. 

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey_sample %>% 
  count(personality, party_bin)

prop.test(x = c(101, 61), n = c(255, 319), conf.level = 0.9, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer: is there a difference in proportions, if so, do North campus or South campus attend more parties?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

Is there significant evidence that students who take STAT 202 at NU on average have over a 3.5 gpa at NU (`gpa_nu`)?

Use the `survey_sample` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the **average** `gpa_nu` at the $\alpha$ = 0.02 significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{gpa} = 3.5$$
$$H_A: \mu_{gpa} \ne 3.5$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
t.test(x = survey_sample$gpa_nu, mu = 3.5, conf.level = 0.98)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```


## survey_sample Data

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **Northwestern Students who take STAT 202 from Fall 2021 - Fall 2023**.

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:


- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (fall 2021 through fall 2023)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `party_bin` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend? (0, 1-4, 5+)"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus)"
- `brain_type` -- "Do you consider yourself more "left" or "right" -brained (left-brain, right-brain)?"
- `marry` -- "What age do you expect to get married?"
- `love_first_sight` -- "Do you believe in love at first sight (Yes, No)?"
- `gpa_nu` -- "What is your current GPA at NU? If unknown type NA."
