## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey_sample` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **Northwestern Students who take STAT 202 from Fall 2021 - Fall 2023**.


<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem for each possible scenario with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

*You do not need the dataset for this application.*

Suppose the number of hours that a student spends on STAT 202 work each week follows a normal distribution with mean 6 hours and sd 1.5. 

What proportion of students spend **between** 5.5 hours and 7 hours a week on STAT 202 work?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(7, mean = 6, sd = 1.5) - pnorm(5.5, mean = 6, sd = 1.5)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

The highest 10% of students spend more than how many hours on STAT 202 work each week?

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.1, mean = 6, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the difference in proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU that are `left-brain` who believe in love at first sight and `right-brain` who believe in love at first sight.

In other words, use the `brain_type` and `love_first_sight` variables in the `survey_sample` data to **construct a 99% confidence interval** for the difference in proportion. 

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```



```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey_sample %>% 
  count(personality, party_bin)

prop.test(x = c(101, 61), n = c(255, 319), conf.level = 0.9, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer: is there a difference in proportions, if so, which brain type tends to believe in love at first sight more?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

Is there significant evidence that students who take STAT 202 at NU on average plan to `marry` before they turn 30?

Use the `survey_sample` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the **average** age a student expects to marry at the $\alpha$ = 0.02 significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{marry} = 30$$
$$H_A: \mu_{marry} \ne 30$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
t.test(x = survey_sample$marry, mu = 30, conf.level = 0.98)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```


## survey_sample Data

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **Northwestern Students who take STAT 202 from Fall 2021 - Fall 2023**.

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202  (fall 2021 through fall 2023)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `party_bin` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend? (0, 1-4, 5+)"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus)"
- `brain_type` -- "Do you consider yourself more "left" or "right" -brained (left-brain, right-brain)?"
- `marry` -- "What age do you expect to get married?"
- `love_first_sight` -- "Do you believe in love at first sight (Yes, No)?"
- `gpa_nu` -- "What is your current GPA at NU? If unknown type NA."
