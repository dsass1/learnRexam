## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been pre-loaded for you. All necessary libraries have been pre-loaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.


### Application 1 (1 points)

Load the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` package.

<br>

Don't forget to click **Submit**. I recommend using **Submit** rather than "Run", that way you don't forget.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (5 points)


Construct a scatterplot of `height_inches` by `father_height`. Set the `color` equal to `gender_ident`.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = father_height, y = height_inches, color = gender_ident)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

In **one sentence** describe the relationship between the height of a student and the height of their father. In **one sentence** state **why** you are or are not surprised by this relationship.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```


### Application 3 (4 points)

Let's determine if students attend more parties if they are in a higher school year. Don't include students that attend 0 parties because we are only interested in students who party.

In other words,

- start with the `survey` data
- remove students that have `num_party` of 0
- compute the mean, standard deviation, and count of `num_party` by `school_year`.
- print/output the results with the **highest mean on top**

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey  %>%
  filter(num_party > 0)  %>%
  group_by(school_year)  %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(num_party, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(num_party, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n())  %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))

```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 4 (5 points)

Construct a side-by-side boxplot of `num_party` by `campus_housing`. 

<br>

Note: `campus_housing` is a binary variable where 0 = South campus and 1 = North campus.

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}


```


```{r App4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = factor(campus_housing), y = num_party)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r App4-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Describe and compare the boxplots between students who live in South and North campus (if you chose not to remove NA values, ignore that boxplot).

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```


**Don't forget to click Submit! Check that ALL applications have been submitted**

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (fall 2021 through winter 2024)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `procrastinator` -- "Do you consider yourself a procrastinator? (Yes, No)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `father_height` -- "How tall is your biological father? (in inches)"
- `mother_height` -- "How tall is your biological mother? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"

```{r}
