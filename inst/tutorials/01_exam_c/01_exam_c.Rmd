## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you. All necessary libraries have been preloaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of RStudio Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.

### Application 1 (4 points)

Construct a scatterplot of `height_inches` by `num_party`. Set the `color` equal to `personality`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = num_party, y = height_inches, color = personality)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

In **one sentence** describe the relationship between the number of parties a student goes to and their height. In **one sentence** state why you are or are not surprised by this relationship.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```


### Application 2 (3 points)

Using the `survey` dataset...

- remove `NA` values for `salary`
- create a new variable called `salary_10k` which is computed as `salary`/10000
- subset the dataset to only contain the columns: `gender_ident`, `salary`, `salary_10k`
- make sure you print/output the results

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(salary)) %>% 
  mutate(salary_10k = salary/10000) %>% 
  select(gender_ident, salary, salary_10k)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 3 (3 points)

Let's determine if happier people have more Instagram followers.

In other words,

- start with the `survey` data
- compute the mean and sd of `followers_insta` by `happy`.
- Print the results in descending order (high to low) based on the mean.

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  group_by(happy) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(followers_insta, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(followers_insta, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```


### Application 4 (5 points)

Let's visualize if happier people have more Instagram followers.

Construct a histogram of `followers_insta` faceted by `happy` using the `survey` dataset. Set the bins equal to 8 and change the border of the histogram to any color.

It will be difficult to see the histograms due to the varying counts. Within your facet layer after your variable add-in the argument `, scale = "free_y"`


```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = followers_insta)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 8)+
  facet_wrap(~ happy, scale = "free_y")
```

```{r App4-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Using your results from Application 3 and 4: Describe and compare the relationship between `followers_insta` and `happy`. 

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (winter 2023, fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Do you consider yourself an Introvert or Extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `smoke_weed` -- "Do you smoke weed? (Yes, Occasionally, No)"
- `followers_insta` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `followers_tiktok` -- "How many followers do you have on TikTok (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"
