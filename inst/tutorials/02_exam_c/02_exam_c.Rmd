## Application

The following applications use the `survey_f` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

The `survey_f` dataset is a subset of the original `survey` data that only includes students who identify as "Female". This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

This code is here for reference. **You do NOT need to do anything with the code below.** Just use the dataset `survey_f` for the problems!

```{r App1, exercise = TRUE}
survey_f <- survey %>% 
  filter(gender_ident == "Female")
```

### Application 1 (8 points)


**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `height_inches` and `mother_height` for female students.

```{r App1a, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

Add the line of best fit to the scatterplot below.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(survey_f, aes(x = mother_height, y = height_inches)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

<br>

**Part 3**

Using the `survey_f` dataset, build a simple linear regression model that predicts `height_inches` using `mother_height`. Store the model as `model_height` and print the `summary()`.

```{r App1c, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 4**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe1}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

Interpret the **slope** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe2}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 2 (5 points)


**Part 1**

Using our `survey_f` dataset, build a simple categorical regression model to predict `num_party` based on `fav_drink`. 

Output the model `summary()` results. 

The variable `fav_drink` has 4 levels: {beer, don't_drink, hard_liquor, wine}

```{r App2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

Use the model output to answer the following questions.

```{r app2Q1}
question_text(
  "App2 Q1) What is the baseline/reference level?<br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```



```{r app2Q2}
question_text(
  "App2 Q2) Female students with what `fav_drink` level are predicted to on average go to the least number of parties a month? <br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```



```{r app2Q3}
question_text(
  "App2 Q3) Female students with what `fav_drink` level are predicted to on average go to the MOST number of parties a month?<br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```
