## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction because it demonstrates a lack of understanding.

<br>

### Application 1 (9 points)

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `height_inches` and `father_height` using the `survey` dataset.

```{r App1a, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  select(height_inches, father_height) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete.obs")
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

<br>

**Part 2**

Visualize the relationship of `height_inches` by `father_height` and add the **line of best fit**.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}
  
```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(height_inches, father_height)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 3**

Using the `survey` dataset, build a simple linear regression model that predicts `height_inches` using `father_height`. Store the model as `model_height` and print the `summary()`.

```{r App1c, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1c-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_height <- lm(height_inches ~ father_height, data = survey)

summary(model_height)
```

```{r App1c-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 4**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


**Part 5**

Add ONLY the residuals from your `model_height` to the code below. 

The code is started for you so that `NA` values are removed and only the relevant column is selected. You can complete this even if you did not complete Part 3.

```{r App1-setup}
model_height <- lm(height_inches ~ father_height, data = survey)
```

```{r App1e, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines =4, exercise.setup = "App1-setup"}
survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height_inches), !is.na(father_height)) %>% 
  select(height_inches)
```


```{r App1e-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height_inches), !is.na(father_height)) %>% 
  select(height_inches) %>% 
  mutate(residuals = residuals(model_height))
```

```{r App1e-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (6 points)

**Part 1**

Build a multiple regression model **with an interaction term** to predict `followers_tiktok` based on `followers_insta` and `gender_ident`. 

Output the model `summary()` results. 

The variable `gender_ident` has 2 levels: {Male, Female}

```{r App2a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App2a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_followers <- lm(followers_tiktok ~ followers_insta * gender_ident, data = survey)

summary(model_followers)
```

```{r App2a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Suppose we have a student that identifies as Male (`gender_ident` = "Male) and has 700 followers on Instagram (`followers_insta` = 700). How many followers do we predict this student has on TikTok?

Use the code chunk below as a calculator to output your prediction (the multiplication symbol is *).

```{r App2b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App2b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
-16.57089 + 0.13591*700 + 46.85162 -0.06134*700
```

```{r App2b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
