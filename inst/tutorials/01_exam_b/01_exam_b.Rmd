## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you. All necessary libraries have been preloaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of RStudio Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.

### Application 1 (5 points)

Construct a scatterplot of `followers_tiktok` by `followers_insta`. Set the `color` equal to `procrastinator`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

In **one sentence** describe the relationship between the number of followers a student has on Instagram and Tiktok. In **one sentence** state why you are or are not surprised by this relationship.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```


### Application 2 (4 points)

Let's determine if North campus, South campus, or off campus students (Neither) attend more parties. Don't include First year students because they are new to school and may not know people yet.

In other words,

- start with the `survey` data
- exclude student's that have `school_year` of "First year"
- compute the average (mean) of `num_party` by `campus_housing`.
- Print the results in ascending order (low to high).

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Application 3 (2 points)

Using the `survey` dataset...

- create a new variable called `height_feet` which is computed as `height_inches`/12
- subset the dataset to only contain the columns: `quarter`, `height_inches`, `height_feet`
- make sure you print/output the results

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


### Application 4 (4 points)

Let's determine if people who `smoke_weed` are happier.

Below we created a `survey_party` dataset which has NA values removed and removed the student's who "Don't know" whether or not they are happy.

Now, construct a barplot of `happy` with `fill` equal to `smoke_weed` using the `survey_party` dataset. 

The counts will distort this interpretation so set the `position` argument that will represent a **proportion** (ie: all bars should be filled to the top at 1).

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}
survey_party <- survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(smoke_weed), happy != "Don't know")


```

Based on the barplot, conclude if this leads you to believe that people who smoke weed are happier.

```{r App4-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (winter 2023, fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `procrastinator` -- "Do you consider yourself a procrastinator? (Yes, No)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `smoke_weed` -- "Do you smoke weed? (Yes, Occasionally, No)"
- `followers_insta` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `followers_tiktok` -- "How many followers do you have on TikTok (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"
