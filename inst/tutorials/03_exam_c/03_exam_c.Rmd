## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem for each possible scenario with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

Suppose the number of followers that a student has on Instagram follows a normal distribution with mean 1000 and sd 300. 

What proportion of students have either **less than** 500 followers or **more than** 1500 followers?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(1500, mean = 1000, sd = 300, lower.tail = FALSE) + pnorm(500, mean = 1000, sd = 300)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Suppose you are constructing a 98% confidence interval for a normal distribution. Calculate any one of the critical values below.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.01)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in determining if `brain_type` impacts a student's expected `salary` after graduation. Are `right-brain` or `left-brain` students expected to make more money?

**Construct a 97% confidence interval** for the difference in average `salary` for `right-brain` and `left-brain` students who take STAT 202 at NU.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```



```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
right <- survey %>% 
  filter(brain_type == "right-brain")

left <- survey %>% 
  filter(brain_type == "left-brain")

t.test(x = right$salary, y = left$salary, conf.level = 0.97)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer: is there a difference in expected salary between brain type for STAT 202 students?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

A national survey reports that 65% of teens actively use TikTok. Let's see if that is true for students who take STAT 202 at NU.

Use the `survey` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU who use `tiktok` at the $\alpha$ = 0.1 significance level.

$$H_0: \pi_{tiktok} = 0.65$$
$$H_A: \pi_{tiktok} \ne 0.65$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey_raw %>% 
  count(tiktok)
prop.test(x = 491, n = c(491+333), p = 0.65, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```
