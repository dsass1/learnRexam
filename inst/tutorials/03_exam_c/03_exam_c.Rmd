## Application

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the average GPA of students who take STAT 202 at Northwestern University. 

Use the `survey` data to construct a 95% confidence interval for the average GPA (`gpa_nu`) of students who take STAT 202 at Northwestern University.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe1}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

### Application 2 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the proportion of students who take STAT 202 at Northwestern University that are `Very happy`. 

Use the `survey` data to construct a 98% confidence interval for the proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU that are `Very happy`.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe2}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (7 points)

Is there significant evidence that `Extrovert`s who take STAT 202 at NU have more Instagram followers (`num_followers`) on average than `Introvert`s who take STAT 202 at NU.

Use the `survey` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the difference in **average Instagram followers** between extroverts and introverts at the $\alpha$ = 0.10 significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{extrovert} - \mu_{introvert} = 0$$
$$H_A: \mu_{extrovert} - \mu_{introvert} \ne 0$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe3}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

- `father_height` -- "How tall is your birth father? (in inches)"
- `mother_height` -- "How tall is your birth mother? (in inches)"
