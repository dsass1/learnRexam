## Application (17 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem for each possible scenario with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the average age a student who takes STAT 202 at Northwestern University expects to `marry`. 

Use the `survey` data to construct a 98% confidence interval for the average age of marriage (`marry`) for students who take STAT 202 at Northwestern University.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
t.test(x = survey$marry, conf.level = 0.98)
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 2 (6 points)

A national survey reports that 90% of teens actively use Instagram. Let's see if that is true for students who take STAT 202 at NU.

Use the `survey` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU who use `instagram` at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 significance level.

$$H_0: \pi_{instagram} = 0.9$$
$$H_A: \pi_{instagram} \ne 0.9$$

```{r App2, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  count(instagram)
prop.test(x = 791, n = c(791+78), p = 0.90, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

<br>

Interpret your p-value and decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in determining if `right-brain` students expect to have a higher `salary` than `left-brain` students after graduation. 

Use the `survey` data to conduct a hypothesis test to determine if `brain_type` impacts `salary` at the $\alpha$ = 0.10 significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{right} - \mu_{left} = 0$$
$$H_A: \mu_{right} - \mu_{left} \ne 0$$


```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```



```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
right <- survey %>% 
  filter(brain_type == "right-brain")

left <- survey %>% 
  filter(brain_type == "left-brain")

t.test(x = right$salary, y = left$salary, conf.level = 0.9)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret your p-value and decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```
