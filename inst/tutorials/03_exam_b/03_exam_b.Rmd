## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem for each possible scenario with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

Suppose the number of minutes that a student athlete exercises each week follows a normal distribution with mean 500 and sd 100. 

What proportion of athletes exercise **between** 350 and 650 minutes?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(650, mean = 500, sd = 100) - pnorm(350, mean = 500, sd = 100)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

The top 20% of athletes exercise more than how many minutes?

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.2, mean = 500, sd = 100, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the difference in proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU that are `Extrovert` who go to "5+" parties a month and `Introvert` who go to "5+" parties a month.

In other words, use the `personality` and `party_bin` variables in the `survey` data to **construct a 90% confidence interval** for the difference in proportion of `Extrovert` s who attend `5+` parties and `Introvert` s who attend `5+` parties. 

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```



```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  count(personality, party_bin)

prop.test(x = c(101, 61), n = c(255, 319), correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer if there is a difference in proportions, if so, do extroverts or introverts attend more parties?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

Is there significant evidence that students who take STAT 202 at NU on average plan to `marry` before they turn 30?

Use the `survey` data to conduct a hypothesis test for the **average** age a student expects to marry at the $\alpha$ = 0.02 significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{marry} = 30$$
$$H_A: \mu_{marry} \ne 30$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
t.test(x = survey$marry, mu = 30, conf.level = 0.98)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```
