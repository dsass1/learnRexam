## Application (15 points)

The following applications use the `salaries` dataset which has been preloaded for you. 

This data is a random sample of Illinois public university professors and includes information such as salary, service, and job title. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "salaries Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.


### Application 1 (1 points)

Load the `tidyverse` package.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (5 points)

Construct a histogram of `base_salary`. Choose an appropriate number of `bins` AND have it defined in code. Change the border `color` to "white".

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = base_salary)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white")
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


Describe the distribution of `base_salary`.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```


### Application 3 (4 points)

Let's determine if base salary varies by department for professors with the title Full Professor.

In other words,

- start with the `salaries` data
- only include professors with a `title` of "Full Professor"
- compute the mean, sd, and count of `base_salary` by `department`.
- print/output the results with the highest mean on top

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
salaries %>% 
  filter(title == "Full Professor") %>% 
  group_by(department) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(base_salary, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(base_salary, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 4 (5 points)

Construct a barplot of `department` with `fill` equal to `gender`. 

The counts will distort this interpretation so set the `position` argument that will represent a **proportion** (ie: all bars should be filled to the top at 1).

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}


```


```{r App4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = department, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

```{r App4-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Based on the barplot, describe the relationship between gender and department.

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```


## salaries Data

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **public university professors in Illinois.**

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `title` -- Identifies the rank of the professor (`Assistant Professor`, `Associate Professor`, `Full Professor`)
- `position` -- "Is the professor an Instructor or Researcher?" (`Instructor`, `Researcher`)
- `gender` -- "What gender does the professor identify as?" (`M`, `F`)
- `department` -- "What department does the professor work for?" (`Business`, `English`, `Math`, `Sociology`)"
- `years_since_phd` -- "Number of years since the professor's PhD was earned."
- `years_service` -- "Number of years of service at this Institution."
- `base_salary` -- "Annual base salary (in $1,000)."
- `additional_comp` -- "Additional compensation earned over the year (in $1,000)."
