## Application (17 points)

The following applications use the `salaries` dataset which has been preloaded for you. 

This data is a random sample of Illinois public university professors and includes information such as salary, service, and job title. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "salaries Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

<br>

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction because it demonstrates a lack of understanding.

<br>


### Application 1 (1 points)

A file named `salaries.csv` is located in a `data/` subdirectory. Use the appropriate `readr` function to read in the dataset and store it as `salaries`. There should not be any printed results.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
salaries <- read_csv("data/salaries.csv")
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (10 points)

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `years_service` and `base_salary`.

```{r App2a, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
salaries %>%
  select(years_service, base_salary) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs")
```

```{r App2a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Visualize the relationship of `base_salary` by `years_service` and add the **line of best fit**.

```{r App2b, exercise = TRUE}
  
```


```{r App2b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = years_service, y = base_salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r App2b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 3**

Build a simple linear regression model that predicts `base_salary` using `years_service`. Store the model as `model_sal`. Output the model results using the `summary()` function. 

<br>

Note: `base_salary` is reported in \$1,000 ie: 50 = \$50,000.

```{r App2c, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App2c-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_sal <- lm(base_salary ~ years_service, data = salaries)
summary(model_sal)
```

```{r App2c-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 4**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem. 

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


**Part 5**

Add the residuals from your model called `model_sal` to the code below. The code is started for you to remove missing values. Now you need to:

1. `select` only the variables `base_salary` and `years_service`
2. Then add a new variable called `residuals` which are equal to the residuals from the model
3. Make sure your results are being output/printed

*You can complete this even if Part 3 is incorrect.*

```{r App2-setup}
model_sal <- lm(base_salary ~ years_service, data = salaries)
```

```{r App2e, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2-setup"}
salaries %>% 
  filter(!is.na(base_salary), !is.na(years_service)) 
```

```{r App2e-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
salaries %>% 
  filter(!is.na(base_salary), !is.na(years_service)) %>%
  select(base_salary, years_service) %>%
  mutate(residuals = residuals(model_sal))
```

```{r App2e-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 3 (4 points)

**Part 1**

Build a multiple regression model **with an interaction term** to predict `base_salary` based on `years_service` and `position`. 

Output the model results using the `summary()` function. 

The variable `position` has 2 levels: {Instructor, Researcher}

```{r App3a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_mult <- lm(base_salary ~ years_service * position, data = salaries)

summary(model_mult)
```


```{r App3a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Suppose a professor is an `Instructor` with 5 years of service (`years_service` = 5). What base salary do we predict this professor earns?

Use the code chunk below as a calculator to output your prediction (the multiplication symbol is *).

```{r App3b, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r App3b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
79.6222 + 6.4277*5 -9.8544 -0.3249*5*1
```


```{r App3b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 4

Using our `salaries` dataset, we built a simple regression model to predict `base_salary` based on `department`. 

<br>

Note: `base_salary` is reported in \$1,000 ie: 50 = \$50,000.

<br>

The model results are shown below:

```{r}

model_dep <- lm(base_salary ~ department, salaries)

summary(model_dep)$coefficients
```


**Part 1 (3 points concept)**

```{r App4-concept}
question_wordbank(
  paste("Using the model output above to answer the following questions. The variable `department` has 4 levels: {Business, English, Math, Sociology} <br>") ,
  choices = c("What is the baseline/reference level?",
            HTML("Professors in what <code>department</code> are predicted to on average earn the <b>LOWEST</b> base salary?"),
            HTML("Professors in what <code>department</code> are predicted to on average earn the <b>HIGHEST</b> base salary?") ),
  wordbank = c("Business", "English", "Math", "Sociology"),
  answer(c("Math","English","Business"), correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    correct = "submitted",
    incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```

**Part 2 (2 points)**

Interpret the coefficient labeled **departmentBusiness** in the **context of the problem**.

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```
