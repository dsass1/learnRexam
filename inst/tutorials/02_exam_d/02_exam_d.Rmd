  a) No, while the stratums are homogenous (within each stratum people share a characteristic) the upper class is being overrepresented in the sample because a small percent of the true population belongs to the upper class. <br>
  b) No, the groups are heterogenous (mini representations of the population) and cluster sampling would be more appropriate.
  c) Yes, since random sampling is used to select people from each stratum this is a good sampling design. <br>

## Application

The following applications use the `survey_m` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

The `survey_m` dataset is a subset of the original `survey` data that only includes students who identify as "Male". This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled.

<br>

This code is here for reference. **You do NOT need to do anything with the code below.** Just use the dataset `survey_m` for the problems!

```{r App1, exercise = TRUE}
survey_m <- survey %>% 
  filter(gender_ident == "Male")
```

### Application 1 (8 points)

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `height_inches` and `father_height` for male students.

```{r App1a, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

Add the line of best fit to the scatterplot below.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(survey_m, aes(x = father_height, y = height_inches)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

<br>

**Part 3**

Using the `survey_m` dataset, build a simple linear regression model that predicts `height_inches` using `father_height`. Store the model as `model_height` and print the `summary()`.

```{r App1c, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 4**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe1}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

Interpret the **slope** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe2}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 2 (5 points)

**Part 1**

Using our `survey_m` dataset, build a simple categorical regression model to predict `num_party` based on `fav_drink`. Output the model `summary()` results. 

The variable `fav_drink` has 4 levels: {beer, don't_drink, hard_liquor, wine}

```{r App2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

Use the model output to answer the following questions.

```{r app2Q1}
question_text(
  "App2 Q1) What is the baseline/reference level?<br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```



```{r app2Q2}
question_text(
  "App2 Q2) Male students with what `fav_drink` level are predicted to on average go to the least number of parties a month? <br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```



```{r app2Q3}
question_text(
  "App2 Q3) Male students with what `fav_drink` level are predicted to on average go to the MOST number of parties a month?<br> <br>
  a) beer <br>
  b) don't_drink <br>
  c) hard_liquor <br>
  d) wine" ,
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```
